Purpose of this website is to improve the personal website of Brent Faiyaz, artist and RNB singer. 
This will let his fans know more about the future pertaining to his music and his tour dates, and also provide extra information on merchandise and external resources to keep up to date with their favourite artist.
Brent Faiyaz is a very lowkey and mysterious person, thus being a big fan of him, I thought making such a website would be useful for not only me, but other fans that want to know more about their favourite artist.



The tour page was very cluttered and did not have sufficient information about shows, so i tweaked that part of the website. I also made it so you could preview his latest album on the website itself, as well as a preview of the youtube video to go along with it. His merch is quite standard, not much selection on the main website as well. Added more interesting backgrounds like GIfs of his recent and older albums for a better design. Made the layout of the website more interactive with animations like eas in and out transitions, as well as hover scale animation.


I used referencing of his main website and and got pictures and gifs of him off the his socials and youtube videos. (https://www.brentfaiyaz.com/) (https://www.instagram.com/brentfaiyaz/) (https://twitter.com/brentfaiyaz)
