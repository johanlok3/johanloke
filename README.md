Purpose of this website is to improve the personal website of Brent Faiyaz, artist and RNB singer. 
This will let his fans know more about the future pertaining to his music and his tour dates, and also provide extra information on merchandise and external resources to keep up to date with their favourite artist.
Brent Faiyaz is a very lowkey and mysterious person, thus being a big fan of him, I thought making such a website would be useful for not only me, but other fans that want to know more about their favourite artist.


The readme is to contain all documentation and research done.
It should also detail down:
● the user audience intent and purpose.
● Who the website is catering for? Value that it is providing to users
● What is the website catering for?
● Attribute all external source code used
